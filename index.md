## About Me

Hello! I'm a physicist interested in fluid dynamics and mathematical modeling. My research focuses on understanding complex fluid systems through both theoretical and computational approaches.

One of the fundamental principles in my work is the continuity equation, which expresses the conservation of mass in a fluid system:

$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0$$

This elegant equation tells us that the rate of change of density ($$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$$) plus the divergence of momentum ($$\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v})$$) must equal zero, representing the conservation of mass in a flowing fluid.
